# Agent foundation (C-001, C-002, C-005)

The solution contains `Corvid.Abstractions`, `Corvid.Kernel`, and
`Corvid.Models`, alongside the working Vault projects. Kernel and Models each
reference Abstractions. `Corvid.Models` has no public types yet; slot contracts
belong to C-006. C-005 added `Corvid.Tools` and its build-time generator,
`Corvid.Tools.Generators` (see [Tools](#tools-c-005)). Add the other projects from the agent plan as their
implementations start, rather than creating empty projects for every future surface.

## Session event log (C-002)

- `Corvid.Abstractions/Events` holds the event contracts: `SessionEvent` and its
  types, and `IEventLog`. The JSON discriminators declared on `SessionEvent`
  (`user_message`, `decision`, `compacted`, ...) are persisted wire names; renaming
  one requires a payload version bump and a migration.
- `Corvid.Kernel/Events` holds `SqliteEventLog`, the source-generated JSON
  context (snake_case, payload version 1) and `SessionProjection`. Abstractions and
  Kernel set `IsAotCompatible`, so the trim and AOT analyzers run on them.
- The log is one SQLite file (WAL, `synchronous=FULL`) with one row per event,
  keyed by session and a one-based sequence. Triggers reject `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.
  `Append` takes the expected head, writes a whole batch or nothing, and throws
  `EventLogConflictException` when another writer got there first. A session
  actor is expected to be the single writer; the check keeps a second writer
  (for example a recovering process) from silently interleaving.
- `SessionProjection` replays a complete prefix into a snapshot: transcript, goal,
  todos, pending approvals, model profiles per slot, decisions with outcomes, and
  checkpoints. `Compacted` replaces its range in the transcript only; the raw
  events stay in the log. Goals, todos and approvals are folded from their own
  events, so compaction cannot remove them. `Load(log, session, throughSequence)`
  projects any earlier position, the basis for resume, branch and undo.
- Persisted events the projection cannot apply (a compaction that splits a tool
  call from its result, an outcome for an unknown decision, duplicate IDs) are
  reported in `SessionSnapshot.Issues` rather than thrown, because an append-only
  log cannot repair them and the session must stay readable.

Not built yet: the session actor and its command channel, rendering a projection
into a model prompt (C-006), full-text search over raw events, branch and fork
sessions that copy a prefix, and schema migrations beyond version 1. SQLite calls
are synchronous; callers that must not block should use a storage worker.

## Dependency rules

- `Corvid.Abstractions` and `Corvid.Vault.Contracts` have no application package or
  project dependencies.
- Production projects under `src/` are core libraries unless named
  `Corvid.Models.*` (for example, `Corvid.Models.Starling`). The base
  `Corvid.Models` project is core, not an adapter.
- Core libraries may reference other core libraries and explicitly reviewed
  infrastructure packages. They may not reference adapters or provider SDKs,
  even indirectly. The package allowlist contains
  `Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions` and, for the event log,
  `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` with its resolved dependencies
  (`Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.Core` and the `SQLitePCLRaw.*` e_sqlite3 bundle). Add infrastructure packages and their
  transitive dependencies to `CorePackages` in the checker when needed; never
  add a provider SDK there.
- Provider SDKs and Starling model packages belong in `Corvid.Models.*` adapters.
  Adapters may reference core projects.
- The Vault executable may reference only `Corvid.Vault.Contracts`. Agent
  projects, including adapters, may not reference the Vault executable.
- `Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks` is allowed everywhere as SDK trim/AOT build
  tooling, not an application dependency.
- Build-tool projects run inside the compiler, not in Corvid. The only one is
  `Corvid.Tools.Generators` (listed in `BuildToolProjects` in the checker). It
  may use only Roslyn and the netstandard2.0 packages Roslyn brings
  (`BuildToolPackages`), and no projects. Other projects consume it as an
  analyzer: `OutputItemType="Analyzer" ReferenceOutputAssembly="false"`. Such a
  reference is not in NuGet's restored graph, so the checker reads analyzer
  project references from each production `.csproj` and fails any that names a
  project outside `BuildToolProjects`. A build-tool project in another
  project's restored graph (an ordinary reference) fails the check.
- Test and development tool projects are outside these production rules. They
  can reference implementations to exercise them, including Vault.

When the composition root (`Corvid.Host`) is implemented, give it an explicit
composition rule allowing adapter references. Do not relax the core library rule
to accommodate it. The current milestone does not create or exempt a host.

## Tools (C-005)

`Corvid.Tools` is a core library (Microsoft.Extensions.AI.Abstractions and
`Corvid.Vault.Client`, for `SecretRef`). It holds the `[Tool]`, `[SideEffect]`,
`[Network]` and `[Destructive]` attributes, `ToolDescriptor` and `ToolRisk`,
the `ToolFunction` base class (an `AIFunction`), argument binding
(`ToolArguments`) and `ToolRegistry`.

`Corvid.Tools.Generators` is an incremental source generator. For each `[Tool]`
method in a top-level partial class it emits a nested `ToolFunction` that binds
arguments with explicit per-type conversions and calls the method directly, the
JSON Schema as a string written at compile time, and the risk metadata. The
class gains `CreateTools()` (and implements `IToolProvider` unless static).
Generated code uses no reflection; the fixture project builds it with the trim
and AOT analyzers on. The schema is computed by the generator, because the
compiler cannot run `AIJsonUtilities`; a test compares it with
`AIJsonUtilities` for every fixture tool. Two differences are deliberate:
`SecretRef` is a string, and array elements are non-null. Unsupported
parameter or return types, invalid or duplicate names, a missing description
and `[Destructive]` without `[SideEffect]` are compile errors (CVTOOL001 to
CVTOOL008).

`ToolRegistry.List()` returns descriptors; `GetFunctions(secretNames)` returns
the tools to offer a model. A `SecretRef` parameter is offered as an enum of
the given Vault catalogue names, and a call naming another secret is refused
before the method runs. With no catalogue, secret-bearing tools are left out
(plan §10.5).

Supported parameter types: `string`, `bool`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `double`,
`decimal`, `Guid`, `DateTime`, `DateTimeOffset`, `Uri`, non-flags enums (by
name), `SecretRef`, nullable forms of these, arrays and lists of them (not of
`SecretRef`), and `CancellationToken`. Return values are limited to types the
chat client can serialize without caller-supplied type information.

Deferred: argument validators beyond type binding (paths inside the
workspace, date ranges), the embedding-examples file, object-typed parameters
and return values (which need a `JsonSerializerContext`), toolsets, platform
presets and `check_fn` availability, and restricting secrets by the catalogue's
toolset bindings. Corvid.Tools contains no built-in tools yet.

## Running the check

```sh
dotnet build Corvid.slnx -c Release
dotnet run --project tools/Corvid.Architecture -c Release --no-build -- .
dotnet test --solution Corvid.slnx -c Release --no-build
```

CI runs all three. The checker enumerates every production `.csproj` under `src/`
and `vault/`, then reads its `obj/project.assets.json`. NuGet's resolved targets
include transitive packages and projects; all restored frameworks and runtime
targets are checked. Project identity comes from the referenced `.csproj` path,
not its configurable assembly name. Unknown packages fail closed in core projects.

Run a fresh build/restore before checking: the checker validates the restored
graph, not edits made after restore. Missing assets fail the check, including for
a new production project omitted from the solution. The repository uses the
standard `obj/` path; custom intermediate paths are not supported. This is an
architecture regression check for NuGet/project references, not a security
sandbox or an IL analyzer for manually supplied binaries.

The next milestones that build on the log are C-006 (slot registry, profiles and
switching) and C-009 (golden set and replay harness).
